# Web-Development


This repo records the self-learning process of Udemy Web-developer-bootcamp.


Throughout the course, I strenghened the ability of HTML5, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, SemanticUI, DOM, jQuery, Command Line, MongoDB and learned NodeJS, NPM, RESTful routes, Database Association, Authentication, Authorization, Deployment.


The hand-on projects of full stack web applications (especially the [Yelpcamp project](Yelpcamp)) help me develop a good understanding of both front-end and back-end development.
